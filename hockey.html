				<p> Hockey is a term used to denote various types of both summer and winter team sports which originated
					on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium.
					<br><br>
					There are many types of hockey. Some games make the use of skates, either wheeled, or bladed while
					others do not. In order to help make the distinction between these various games, the word "hockey"
					is often preceded by another word i.e. "field hockey", "ice hockey", "roller hockey", "rink hockey",
					or "floor hockey".
					<br><br>
					In each of these sports, two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre the object of
					play, either a type of ball or a disk (such as a puck), into the opponent's goal using a hockey
					stick. Two notable exceptions use a straight stick and an open disk (still referred to as a "puck")
					with a hole in the center instead. The first case is a style of floor hockey whose rules were
					codified in 1936 during the Great Depression by Canada's Sam Jacks. The second case involves a
					variant which was later modified in roughly the 1970s to make a related game that would be
					considered suitable for inclusion as a team sport in the newly emerging Special Olympics. The floor
					game of gym ringette, though related to floor hockey, is not a true variant due to the fact that it
					was designed in the 1990s and modelled off of the Canadian ice skating team sport of ringette, which
					was invented in Canada in 1963. Ringette was also invented by Sam Jacks, the same Canadian who
					codified the rules for the open disk style of floor hockey 1936.
					<br><br>
					In most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United
					States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.

				<h2>History</h2><hr>
						<p>In more recent history, the word "hockey" is used in reference to either the summer sport of
						field hockey, which is a stick and ball game, and the winter ice team skating sports of bandy
						and ice hockey. This is due to the fact that field hockey and other stick and ball sports and
						their related variants preceded games which would eventually be played on ice with ice skates,
						namely bandy and ice hockey, as well as sports involving dry floors such as roller hockey and
						floor hockey. However, the "hockey" referred to in common parlance often depends on locale,
						geography, and the size and popularity of the sport involved. For example, in Europe, "hockey"
						more typically refers to field hockey, whereas in Canada, it typically refers to ice hockey. In
						the case of bandy, the game was initially called "hockey on the ice" and preceded the
						organization and development of ice hockey, but was officially changed to "bandy" in the early
							20th century in order to avoid confusion with ice hockey, a separate sport.</p>

						<h2>Bandy</h2>
						<br>

						<center><img align="center" src="images/Bandy.jpeg" alt="hockey" width="50%"></center>
						<br>
						Bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice arena (bandy rink), typically
						outdoors, and with many rules similar to association football. It is played professionally in
						Russia and Sweden. The sport is recognized by the IOC; its international governing body is
						the Federation of International Bandy.
						<br><br>
						Bandy has its roots in England in the 19th century, was originally called "hockey on the
						ice",[14] and spread from England to other European countries around 1900; a similar Russian
						sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called "Russian
						hockey". Bandy World Championships have been played since 1957 and Women's Bandy World
						Championships since 2004. There are national club championships in many countries and the top
						clubs in the world play in the Bandy World Cup every year.

							<h2>Field Hockey</h2>
							<center><img src="images/Field Hockey.jpeg" alt="hockey" width="50%"></center>
							Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial
							turf, with a small, hard ball approximately 73 mm (2.9 in) in diameter. The game is popular
							among both males and females in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Asia,
							Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina. In most countries, the game is played
							between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex.
							<br><br>
							The governing body is the 126-member International Hockey Federation (FIH). Men's field
							hockey has been played at each Summer Olympic Games since 1908 except for 1912 and 1924,
							while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980.
							<br><br>
							Modern field hockey sticks are constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon
							fibre (sometimes both) and are J-shaped, with a curved hook at the playing end, a flat
							surface on the playing side and a curved surface on the rear side. All sticks are
							right-handed – left-handed sticks are not permitted.
							<br><br>
							While field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century England, primarily in
							schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly
							established. The first club was created in 1849 at Blackheath in south-east London. Field
							hockey is the national sport of Pakistan.[15] It was the national sport of India until the
							Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports declared in August 2012 that India has no national
							sport.

							<h2>Ice Hockey</h2>
							<center><img src="images/Ice Hockey.jpeg" alt="hockey" width="50%"></center>
							<br>
							Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a
							three-inch-diameter (76.2 mm) vulcanized rubber disc called a puck. This puck is often
							frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice.
							The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other
							countries around the world. It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the
							Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia[17] and the
							national winter sport of Canada.[18] Ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all
							ages.
							<br><br>
							The governing body of international play is the 77-member International Ice Hockey
							Federation (IIHF). Men's ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and
							was in the 1920 Summer Olympics. Women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics in
							1998. North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey
							league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe. The NHL rules are slightly
							different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories. International ice
							hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s.[19]
							<br><br>
							The contemporary sport developed in Canada from European and native influences. These
							included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where
							two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks. These were played outdoors on
							ice under the name "hockey" in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under
							various other names.[20] In Canada, there are 24 reports[21] of hockey-like games in the
							19th century before 1875 (five of them using the name "hockey"). The first organized and
							recorded game of ice hockey was played indoors in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on March 3,
							1875, and featured several McGill University students.
							<br><br>
							Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a
							blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright
							and can legally curve either way, for left- or right-handed players.
