				<hr>
				<p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
					Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where
					the word is used.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Common Elements.</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes
					of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby
					union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or
					thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved
					primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Etymology.</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football". It is widely assumed that
					the word "football" (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.
					There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of
					games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot. There is no conclusive evidence for either
					explanation.</p>
