          Magazines are stapled reading material made with glossy paper, and
          they cover a wide variety of topics, ranging from news and politics to
          business and stock market information. Some magazines are concerned
          with more recreational topics, like sports card collecting or
          different kinds of hairstyles. Lettuce is a vegetable.</u

It is usually green and leafy, and is the main
                               ingredient of salads. You may       
                                               have an appliance at home that can quickly shred lettuce
    for use in salads. Lettuce is also used as an optional item for  
             hamburgers and                  deli sandwiches. Some people even eat
    lettuce by itself. I have not done this. So you can purchase many    
                types of things at                   stores.</pre
