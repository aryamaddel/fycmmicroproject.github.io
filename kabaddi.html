				Kabaddi is a contact team sport with origins in Ancient India.
				Played between two teamsof seven players, the
				objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to asa "raider", to run into
				the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return
				to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders,and in a single breath.
				Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for
				stopping the raider. </p>
				<p2>Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but are
					brought back in for each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.It is popular in the Indian
					subcontinent and other surrounding Asian countries. Although accounts of kabaddi appear in the
					hisrories
					of ancient India, the game was popularised as a competitive sport in the 20th century. It is the
					national
					sport of Bangladesh. It is the state game of the Indian states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
					Haryana,Karnataka,Kerala, Maharashtra,Odisha,Punjab, Telangana,and Uttar Pradesh.There are two major
					disciplines of kabaddi: "Punjabi kabaddi", also referred to as "circle styles", comprises
					traditional
					forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the "standard style", played
					on
					a rectangular court
					indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such
					as the
					Asian Games.
					This game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi
					or
					chedugudu in
					Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabadi or ha-du-du in
					West
					Bengal and
					Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India,
					hu-do-do in
					India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu.</p>

					<h1>History of kabaddi</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>Although unverified, theories from various sources state that kabaddi originated from the Vedic
						period of ancient India.
						The game was said to have been popular among
						the Yadava people; an abhang by Tukaram stated that the god Krishna played the game in his
						youth, while the Mahabharata
						contains an account of Arjuna being able to sneak into
						hostile areas also take out enemies unscathedâ€”a passage said to parallel the gameplay of
						kabaddi.</p>
					<p2>There are also accounts of Gautama Buddha having played the game recreationally.Despite these
						conflicting
						claims, modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various
						forms under different names in the Indian continent. India has been first credited with having
						helped to popularise
						kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s,
						their introduction to
						the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi
						Federation
						in 1950, and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New
						Delhi.</p2>
					<p3>These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played in
						villages, for legitimate
						international competition.
						After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, Kabaddi was added to the Asian
						Games programme
						beginning in 1990.
