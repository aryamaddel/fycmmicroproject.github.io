				<p>Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one
					another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball
					(approximately 9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches in
					diameter mounted 10 feet high) to a backboard at each end of the court, while preventing the
					opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</p>

				<h2>History.</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the
					International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in
					Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day. He sought a
					vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long
					New England winters. After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in
					gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score
					points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall. Naismith wrote the basic rules and
					nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track. Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its
					bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each "basket" or point
					scored. This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls
					to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.</p>

				<h2>Equipment.</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular
					surface with baskets at opposite ends. Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as
					clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock
					systems.</p>
