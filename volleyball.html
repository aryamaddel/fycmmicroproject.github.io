				<p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries
					to score points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>History</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>In December 1895, in Holyoke, Massachusetts (United States), William G. Morgan, a YMCA physical
					education director, created a new game called Mintonette, a name derived from the game of badminton,
					as a pastime to be played (preferably) indoors and by any number of players. The game took some of
					its characteristics from other sports such as baseball, tennis and handball. Another indoor sport,
					basketball, was catching on in the area, having been invented just ten miles (sixteen kilometres)
					away in the city of Springfield, Massachusetts, only four years before. Mintonette was designed to
					be an indoor sport, less rough than basketball, for older members of the YMCA, while still requiring
					a bit of athletic effort.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Refinements and later developments</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>The first official ball used in volleyball is disputed; some sources say Spalding created the first
					official ball in 1896, while others claim it was created in 1900. The rules evolved over time: in
					1916, in the Philippines, the skill and power of the set and spike had been introduced, and four
					years later a "three hits" rule and a rule against hitting from the back row were established. In
					1917, the game was changed from requiring 21 points to win to a smaller 15 points to win. In 1919,
					about 16,000 volleyballs were distributed by the American Expeditionary Forces to their troops and
					allies, which sparked the growth of volleyball in new countries.</p>
				<hr>
				<h2>Court Dimensions.</h2>
				<p>A volleyball court is 9 m × 18 m (29.5 ft × 59.1 ft), divided into equal square halves by a net with
					a width of one meter (39.4 in). The top of the net is 2.43 m (7 ft 11+11⁄16 in) above the center of
					the court for men's competition, and 2.24 m (7 ft 4+3⁄16 in) for women's competition, varied for
					veterans and junior competitions.</p>
