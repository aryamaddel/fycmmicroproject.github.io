						<h2>1. LeBron James<br>Birthdate: 30 December 1984<br></h2>
						<center><img src="./images/LeBron_James.jpg" alt="LeBron James" width=50%></center>
					</li>
					<p>LeBron James is the greatest player of all time. He has dominated the NBA since he came into the
						league at the young age of 18, fresh out of high school. When James came into the league, he was
						looked at as "The Chosen One" who would take the mantle of greatest from Jordan, and he did.
						LeBron has done things that no other player before him has been able to do. He carried a
						decrepit 2007 Cleveland Cavaliers team to the Finals all on his own. He's defeated not one but
						two of the league's greatest dynasties for championships in the San Antonio Spurs and Golden
						State Warriors. He also brought a championship to Cleveland after a 52-year championship
						drought.</p>

						<h2>2. Michael Jordan<br>Birthdate: 17 February 1963<br></h2>
						<center><img src="./images/Michael_Jordan.jpg" alt="Michael Jordan" width=50%></center>
					</li>
					<p>Jordan is the greatest scorer in the history of the game. He wasn't born with the power of Shaq
						or the size of Kareem, and yet he could not be stopped by any player on the court. He won the
						league's scoring title 10 times during his career, and this piled on the wins. Jordan won more
						than anyone. He set a record for wins in a season with the Bulls in 1996 when he led the team to
						72 victories and a championship, a feat that wasn't broken for 20 years. He also has two
						separate threepeat championship runs, and a perfect 6â€“0 Finals record.</p>

						<h2>3. Shaquille O'Neal<br>Birthdate: 6 March 1972<br></h2>
						<center><img src="./images/Shaquille_O'Neal.jpg" alt="Shaquille O'Neal" width=50%></center>
					</li>
					<p>Shaquille "Shaq" O'Neal is the most dominant player in the history of the NBA. He played center
						for the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and
						Boston Celtics. Shaq was also known as "Diesel" due to the fact that he was a hulk of a man. He
						stood 7'1" and weighed in around 325 pounds. Despite Shaq's enormous size and power, he was much
						more than an unstoppable force due to his size. Shaq was incredibly athletic, handling the ball
						well and being able to find his way in and out of lanes to score and grab rebounds. He famously
						played Michael Jordan one-on-one and crossed Jordan on his way to the basket.</p>

						<h2>4. Kobe Bryant<br>Birthdate: 23 August 1978<br></h2>
						<center><img src="./images/Kobe_Bryant.jpg" alt="Kobe Bryant" width=50%></center>
					</li>
					<p>Kobe "The Black Mamba" Bryant defined the 2000s. He was drafted directly out of high school in
						the 1996 NBA draft by the Charlotte Hornets with the 13th overall pick. The Los Angeles Lakers
						had worked out a deal the day prior to obtain the pick from the Hornets, allowing them to take
						Bryant. His rookie contract with the Lakers was for $3.5 million.</p>

						<h2>5. Tim Duncan<br>Birthdate: 25 April 1976<br></h2>
						<center><img src="./images/Tim_Duncan.jpg" alt="Tim Duncan" width=50%></center>
					</li>
					<p>Tim "The Big Fundamental" Duncan is the greatest power forward to ever play in NBA history. He
						was selected first overall by the San Antonio Spurs in 1997 and would play his entire 19-year
						career with the Spurs. Duncan wasn't a flashy player but he was incredibly efficient both
						offensively and defensively. With the guidance of coach Gregg Popovich, Duncan was able to be
						the head of a dynasty that lasted nearly two decades. During his career, he won five
						championships over elite players such as LeBron James twice, Ben Wallace, Jason Kidd, and
						others.</p>
